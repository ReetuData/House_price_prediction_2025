## Problem Statements
___________________________________________________________________________________

Some potential problem statements for a house price prediction: 

- Predicting Single family house prices based on historical data from 2007 - 2022.
- Identifying key factors influencing house prices.
- Handling missing data and issue of outliers in house price predictions 
- Evaluating the impact of age and renovations on house prices.
- Exploring regional variations in house prices.
- Predicting house price trends over time considering factors such as market conditions, economic indicators, and demographic changes.
- Building a user-friendly house price prediction tool.
- Comparing different regression models for house price predictions.
- Incorporating external data sources like mortgage rates, housing market indices, or demographic data for improved predictions.

## Gather and Understand Data
___________________________________________________________________________________

There are few data sources to collect Real estate datasets. Each had its own pros and cons

- Public Data Sources
- Real Estate Websites
- Kaggle 
- Data Marketplaces 
- Local Real Estate Associations

___________________________________________________________________________________

For this project, I have selected Real estate websites(Redfin or Realtor.com) because of extensive property listings and related information. Their APIs or data feeds can provide up-to-date data, including property details, prices, and market trends.

Later, we can use more data sources to add  additional information needed to improve the predicted outcomes. 

## Access and Acquire Data 
___________________________________________________________________________________

- Database Queries
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Web Scraping
- File Downloads
- Data Providers and Partnerships
- Public Data Repositories
- Surveys and Questionnaires

### Data Extraction and Transformation 

- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or 
- Web Scraping or both
- Transformation Load/Load Transformation

### Storage and organization

- DBMS: Postgre SQL Server/Data warehouse/File stotrgae system

### Documnetation

- describes the data sources,attributes, formats and preprrocessing steps 

### Handle Data Privacy and Security

- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and maintain the security of sensitive information

### Validate and Verify Data

- Perform data validation and verification checks to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Compare data from different sources or cross-reference with external references to validate the consistency and correctness of the data.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploration

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships in the data. Visualize the data to gain insights.

## Feature Engineering

Identify and create relevant features from the available data that can help in solving the problem. This may involve transforming, combining, or scaling the data. It can involve of deriving meaningful features.

## Model Selection and Training

Select appropriate machine learning algorithms or other modeling techniques based on the problem and data characteristics. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. Train and optimize the selected models using suitable evaluation metrics.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Assess their robustness, accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant measures. Perform model validation to ensure generalizability.

## Model Deployment

Once satisfactory model is ready, prepare it for deployment. This may involve creating APIs or integration with existing systems. Ensure the model is scalable, efficient, and can handle real-time or batch predictions, depending on the application.

## Monitor and Maintain

Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model. Track its predictions, compare them with ground truth, and assess its effectiveness over time. Retrain or update the model as needed to adapt to changing conditions or data shifts.

## Documentation and Communication

Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation results. Communicate your findings, insights, and limitations of the project to stakeholders in a clear and understandable manner.
